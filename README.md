This project aims to integrate discrete choice models (DCMs), specifically the Multinomial Logit model (MNL) and Multivariate Multinomial Logit Model (MV-MNL), with assortment optimisation (AO) in order to find a menu assortment from restaurant data that optimises for carbon footprint score. The combination of DCMs and assortment optimisation for this application has not been explored before, hence presenting a novel area of research. In fact, assortment optimisation has rarely been applied in the food industry as a whole. The main objectives of the study are as follows:
  To apply different techniques for the estimation of DCM parameters, namely the expectation-maximisation algorithm and maximum likelihood estimation.
  To use the results from the estimation within an optimisation framework that optimises for carbon footprint score.
  To pre-process and scrape a dataset in order to obtain meaningful information on the nutritional content and environmental impact of the dishes.
  To apply these methods to a real dataset containing restaurant transaction data.
